# Project-Tek-1-Lemin

The objective of the project is to create a GPS for ants. We need to create an algorithm that allows ants to move between 
rooms and tunnels. 
They must all arrive at the last room, taking into account that there can only be one ants per room and per tunnel except
for the start and finish.

The binary displays the number of the ant that is moving and the location where it is at each "tic".
If the map is invalid the binary just displays the map without moving the ants.
The project contains a series of test maps.

Usage: ./lem_in < map
